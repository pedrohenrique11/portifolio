      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>I've always been captivated by how technology is capable of changing people's lives, helping with everyday or more important issues. With this in mind, I started studying programming with the intention of creating something, something that could help in some way. I'm currently studying at EBAC, where I'm specializing as a JavaScript developer and its freamworks like Vue.js and React.Come check out some of the projects!</p>
